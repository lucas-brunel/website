Hi, I'm Lucas Brunel. I am a final-year PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at ONERA and LIMOS.

My work focuses on uncertainty propagation using surrogate models with functional outputs. I am particularly interested in random sets, Bayesian modelling and dimensionality reduction.

I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position starting in March 2026.
